    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups of masa harina</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>2 cups warm water, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 quart oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong> Whisk masa harina and salt together in a bowl.
        Stir in enough water until dough is smooth and holds together.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong>Form dough into twelve 2-inch balls. Place balls
        onto parchment paper and flatten to 1/2-inch thick circles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to
        400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong>Working in batches, fry a few sopes at a time
        until lightly browned, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer with tongs to
        a paper towel-lined plate and let cool just until they can be handled, 2
        to 3 minutes. Pinch the edges of each sope together to form a little
        boat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong>Return sopes to the hot oil and fry until golden
        and cooked through, 1 to 2 more minutes. Drain on paper towels.
      </li>
    </ul>
