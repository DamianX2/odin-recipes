    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>6 large poblano peppers</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded cheese (or cooked meat of your choice)</li>
      <li>4 large eggs, separated</li>
      <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Optional: Tomato sauce for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong> Roast the poblano peppers over an open flame or
        under a broiler until the skin is charred. Place them in a plastic bag
        for 10 minutes to steam, then peel off the skin. Carefully make a slit
        in each pepper and remove the seeds.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Stuff each pepper with cheese or your preferred
        filling and close the slit with a toothpick if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Beat the egg whites in a bowl until stiff peaks
        form. Gently fold in the yolks and season with salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Lightly coat each stuffed pepper with flour and
        then dip it into the egg mixture, ensuring it's fully covered.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Fry
        each pepper until golden brown on all sides, then drain on paper towels.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 6:</strong> Serve hot with tomato sauce or enjoy as is!
